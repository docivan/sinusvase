[V] there is an ugly seam on the back btw last and first pts - something with arange??
[V] disable params by setting them to 0, then debug each => numerical values
[ ] json configs instead? would be cool for different designs
[V] other function responses than sinus / trigonometry - square? triangle? (just a func with input = 0..2pi, out = 0..1)
[ ] more functions - something exponential?
[V] povray output + rendering
[ ] input config via argparse?
[ ] batch run + compile all possible rendered combinations
